# Tic-Tac-Toe Web App

This is a mobile-responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a linear gradient background, pop-up notifications for player wins and draws, and a button to start a new game.

## Features

- Mobile responsive design
- Linear gradient background
- Displays player win and draw outcomes in a pop-up screen
- Button to start a new game

## Requirements

- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

## How to Set Up and Run the Project on VS Code

### Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open Visual Studio Code after the installation.

### Step 2: Download the Project Files

1. Clone or download the project files to your computer:
   - If you are using Git, run the following command in your terminal to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-repository/tic-tac-toe-game.git
     ```
   - Or, download the project as a ZIP file from the repository and extract it on your computer.

### Step 3: Open the Project in Visual Studio Code

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on **File** in the top-left menu.
3. Select **Open Folder** and navigate to the location where the project files are saved on your computer.
4. Select the folder that contains the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` files, and click **Open**.

### Step 4: Running the Project

1. In the project folder, locate the `index.html` file.
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select **Open with Live Server** (if you have the Live Server extension installed).
   - If you don’t have the Live Server extension installed, you can install it via the VS Code Extensions marketplace:
     - Open **Extensions** (on the sidebar or press `Ctrl + Shift + X`).
     - Search for "Live Server" and install it.
   - After installation, right-click `index.html` again and select **Open with Live Server**.
3. The Tic-Tac-Toe game will now open in your default web browser.

### Step 5: How to Play

- Click on any cell in the grid to place your mark (either "X" or "O").
- The game alternates between players "X" and "O" after each move.
- When a player wins or the game ends in a draw, a pop-up will display the result.
- Click the "New Game" button in the pop-up to reset the board and start a new game.
